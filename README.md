# NOTES:<br>
@ if you get error 80010017 launching homebrew that simply means HEN failure, restart console and try again!(restart is important!) also try deleting cache, browsing data, cookies and the likes from browser, make the exploit page the home page<br>
# DEVELOPERS:<br>
-#define SYSCALL8_OPCODE_IS_HEN ⇨ 0x1337<br>
-using this if return 0x1337 its hen<br>
-ADVANCED POKE:syscall8(0x7003, addr, value); ⇨ this allows poking any location in lv2 memory BUT you have to restore original value before exiting to another application or exiting to xmb.USE WISELY OTHERWISE PS3 SHUTS DOWN<br>
- BDMIRROR:Managunz FTW!(please use Cobra payload because by default its MULTIMAN)<br>
- NOTE:mounting dev_blind will actually mount dev_flash. change files directly from dev_flash instead or hdd0/plugins/CFW/<br>
- Kernel Mode returns 0x53434500 on success to user webkit 0x8a000000. its good to measure HEN success. right now hen is already close to or is 100%<br>
